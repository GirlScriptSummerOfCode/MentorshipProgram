# GirlScript Summer Of Code 2018 - Mentorship Program

#### What is GirlScript Summer of Code? 
GirlScript India is organising GirlScript Summer of Code this year. As of now 800+ participants have registered all across the country and we aim to complete 30+ open source projects under the program. 

#### Girlscript Summer Of Code Mentorship Program 
The Summer Of Code includes a mentorship program in which mentors will guide the projects to completion by creating issues and tutoring the novice to have a learning experience at the Summer of Code.

You can either **be a mentor for a project** or **you can submit your own projects for GSSOC**. Apart from the above project ideas, GSSOC'18 will also include the development of websites for various NGO organizations and Open web literacy programs.

#### Your responsibilities as a mentor
All the projects will have labels associated with it clarifying the skill set required for significant contributions to the project which makes it more feasible for the participants to make pull requests in the proposed projects.  
The mentors would be required to maintain a leaderboard of the contributions of all their mentees.  Also, the mentors are supposed to give biweekly evaluation of the participants under their project to their respective project admin and the organizing team.  This would help in the overall evaluation of all the participants during the last week. 

#### Awards and Goodies
All hard work comes with a reward. Mentors will be awarded a **certificate of recognition from GirlScript India**. Moreover, being a mentor for a 3 month long All India Open Source Event would be an amazing learning experience as well. Mentors will also recieve an awesome GirlScript Tshirt and exciting goodies after successful completition as a mentor during GirlScript Summer of Code 2018.
