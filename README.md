<h1 align="center"> GirlScript Summer Of Code 2018 - Mentorship Program </h1>

## What is GirlScript Summer of Code?

GirlScript India is organising GirlScript Summer of Code this year. This is an opensource event where novice as well as seasoned developers from all over India come together to work on projects. Beginners get a nice opportunity to learn and work on a real world project at the same time.

As of now around 900 participants have registered all across the country and we aim to complete 30+ open source projects under the program.

<h1 align="center"> üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Girlscript Summer Of Code Mentorship Program </h1>

The Summer Of Code includes a mentorship program in which mentors will guide the projects to completion by creating issues and tutoring the novice to have a learning experience at the Summer of Code. Not only beginners but also experienced developers will have an opportunity to connect with a mentor and learn new things. Therefore, mentors play a vital role in making this a successful event.

You can either **mentor for a project** or **you can submit your own projects to be completed during GSSOC**. Apart from the above project ideas, GSSOC'18 will also include the development of websites for various NGO organizations and Open-Web Literacy programs.

<h2 align="center"> üë©‚Äçüè´ Your responsibilities as a mentor</h2>

1.  All the projects will have labels associated with it clarifying the skill set required for significant contributions to the project which makes it more feasible for the participants to make pull requests in the proposed projects.
2.  The mentors would be required to maintain a leaderboard of the contributions of all their mentees.
3.  Also, the mentors are supposed to give biweekly evaluation of the participants under their project to their respective project admin and the organizing team. This would help in the overall evaluation of all the participants.

<h2 align="center"> üñ• Submitting your project </h2>

Apart from being a mentor, you can also submit your own project ideas to be completed during GSSOC. You can chose to be a mentor for your submitted projects.

Projects can be from any field (Web Development, Android Development, Software Development, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning, Design) and can use any languages/softwares.

We would appreciate if you can contribute with multiple project ideas and it will be an icing on the cake if you choose to be a mentor as well.
